    description: "The Rocket at Dusty Divot launches into the sky, the Time Machine attached to the rocket causes it to glitch into different objects, such as a shark and a Crackshot figure. The rocket then accelerates towards the tail of the meteor, creating a rift behind it. Multiple rockets, presumably the Seven, repeatedly teleport from behind the meteor into a rift in front of the meteor, picking up speed each time. The meteor eventually starts moving, whilst also transforming into different objects. This causes the meteor to disappear into the rift. Following this, another rift opens up above Loot Lake, the rocket appears from the rift, aiming directly towards the Zero Point. Following the original rocket, the remaining few rockets guide the meteor which is repeatedly transforming towards the Zero Point, causing the meteor to implode the Zero Point, and create a black hole that swallows the entire island. After the entire island was swallowed and nothing was left behind, the Big Bang, a massive explosion of psychedelic patterns, occured. The player is then shown shooting through space following a trail of items presumably from a different universe. The player is then shown previews of the upcoming gamemodes, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, along with an Eminem Concert which serves as a preview for Fortnite Festival. The event ends with The Looper witnessing and passing by the other galaxies created; locating the reality which contains Helios. A New Era of Fortnite begins...",
